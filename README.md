## 🚀 Features  

### 1️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)  
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** + **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  
- Trains on uploaded dataset with `text` and `sentiment` columns.  
- Preprocessing:  
  - Lowercasing  
  - Tokenization (NLTK)  
  - Stopword removal  
- Predictions:  
  - Output **Predicted Sentiment** (Positive/Negative/Neutral, etc.).  
  - Display **confidence probabilities**.  
  - Visualization with **bar chart of sentiment probabilities**.
 
  - # 📝 Sentiment Analysis Module  

## 📌 Introduction  
The **Sentiment Analysis module** is designed to evaluate customer feedback, social media posts, or reviews and classify them into sentiment categories such as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  

This functionality enables businesses to:  
- Understand customer emotions and satisfaction levels.  
- Identify common complaints and areas of improvement.  
- Measure brand perception and market response.  

---

## 🔍 How It Works  

### 1. Data Input  
- The model expects a CSV file with at least two columns:  
  - **`text`** → Customer reviews or feedback.  
  - **`sentiment`** → Pre-labeled sentiment class (Positive/Negative/Neutral).  
- Example:  

| text                           | sentiment   |  
|--------------------------------|-------------|  
| "I love this product!"         | Positive    |  
| "Worst experience ever."       | Negative    |  
| "It was okay, nothing special" | Neutral     |

### 2. Preprocessing  
Raw customer text often contains noise. Before training, we apply **NLP preprocessing steps**:  
- Lowercasing text.  
- Tokenization (splitting text into words).  
- Stopword removal (removing common words like "the", "is", "and").  
- Converting cleaned tokens back into meaningful strings.  

✔️ Example:  
Input: "The service was amazing!"
Prediction: Positive (Confidence: 92%)

### 5. Prediction and Visualization  
When a user inputs new text:  
1. Text is preprocessed.  
2. Converted into TF-IDF vector.  
3. Model predicts the most likely sentiment.  
4. Results are displayed as:  
   - **Predicted sentiment label**.  
   - **Probability distribution across all sentiment classes**.  
   - **Bar chart visualization of confidence scores**.

## 📈 Business Value  

- 📊 **Customer Insights**: Provides a quick way to measure satisfaction.  
- 🛠️ **Decision Support**: Helps managers understand what customers feel about products/services.  
- 🔍 **Trend Monitoring**: Detects positive or negative spikes in customer sentiment over time.  
- 🎯 **Targeted Action**: Negative clusters can be addressed faster, positive clusters used for marketing.

## ✨ Future Enhancements  

- Integration with **real-time social media APIs** (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).  
- Use of **deep learning models (BERT, LSTM)** for improved accuracy.  
- Multi-language support for global applications.  
- Automated dashboards for **sentiment trend analysis over time**.

## 🙌 Summary  

The **Sentiment Analysis module** transforms raw customer feedback into **actionable insights**. By combining **NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and SVM classification**, it provides an accurate, explainable, and manager-friendly tool to monitor and respond to customer sentiment effectively.

### 2️⃣ Customer Segmentation  
- Upload customer dataset (CSV).  
- Numerical features are standardized using **StandardScaler**.  
- Clustering performed using **K-Means (k=5)**.  
- Output:  
  - Each customer is assigned to a **segment**.  
  - Visualization in **scatter plot** (selectable X and Y axes).  
  - Summary statistics for each cluster (mean, count).

### 3️⃣ Sales Dashboard  
- Upload sales dataset with `Date, Sales, Orders, ROI`.  
- Features:  
  - Filter by **custom date range**.  
  - KPIs:  
    - 💰 Total Sales  
    - 📦 Average Daily Orders  
    - 📈 Average ROI  
  - Visualize **sales trend over time** using line chart.
